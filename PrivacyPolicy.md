# Privacy Policy for SmartReply

**Effective Date:** [Insert date]

SmartReply is a Chrome extension designed to improve your messaging productivity by providing AI-powered message suggestions on supported platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Telegram.

## Information We Collect

SmartReply does **not collect, store, or transmit** any personal or sensitive user data to any external servers. All processing (including retrieval of chat content and AI suggestion generation) is done locally in the browser, using your provided OpenAI API key.

## Use of the OpenAI API

When suggestions are generated, SmartReply sends the relevant chat context and your prompt to the OpenAI API. This communication is done securely via HTTPS. SmartReply **does not log or retain** any data transmitted to OpenAI.

Users are responsible for reviewing and accepting OpenAI’s terms of service and privacy policy when using their API key.

## Permissions

SmartReply requests the minimum permissions necessary to:
- Read recent messages from supported chat web pages
- Insert suggested replies into the message input field
- Configure user preferences (API key, display name)

These permissions are used strictly to fulfill the extension’s core functionality.

## Third-Party Services

SmartReply uses OpenAI’s API for natural language generation. No other third-party services are involved.

## Data Security

All data remains local unless explicitly sent to OpenAI via your API key. Your settings (API key and display name) are stored locally using Chrome’s secure storage mechanism.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns, contact:

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this policy as needed. You will be notified of any major changes on the extension’s homepage or store listing.
